## Overview
Propose an Incubator Community where developers can join one or more companies/projects and contribute to development. In this world of github where code is shared in a virtual environment, perhaps we're ready to take this a step further into a world where the entire company is virtual. In this world contributors are compensated for time spent developing ideas, and investors can also contribute funding for ownership.

The idea is this would enable better capitulization amd work environment by creating transparent companies. 

## Contributor Community
The ideas here is that developers are getting bored working for the same company, and would like to work for cutting edge comnpanies working on cool new stuff. Companies are increasingly finding it difficult to attract good talent to projects. Propose a website like github where a startup company can be created online and people can join through word of mouth, invitation, or searching. Like minded individuals can discuss the projects virtually, and join into teams. Compensation is already built into the community website, and contributors are paid according to agreements made between the project owners and the contributors. An individual could also contibute to the source code of a project for a short period of time to show their talent or initiative and then be asked to join as a payed contributor.

Another aspect of this community is tracking an individual's performance, which makes hiring solid contributors easier. Also, a companies perforamnce is measured as well, which eases contributor's apprehension joining a company.

Finally, this doesn't just need to be for the software community. This could also be a community of ideas as well.

## Compensation and Contracts
A big part of this idea is a setting up contracts regarding compensation and company ownership that are enforced. Propose supplying boiler plate contracts that a company ownsers can just pick. Then, the site will enforece these contracts. Issues regarding how to structure and compensate contrbutors is made easier, since the owners can just pick from common corporate structures. It is also possible to modify contracts, which are also enforced. But, modified contracts must still be fair for contributors and investors alike.

## Investor Community
It is also logical that investors can pick the companies they think will be succesful by investing money into the company for shares of stock. These arrangments are set in advance using contracts chosen by the company. Information regarding company perforamnce, code developement, and employee turnover and background is readily available.
